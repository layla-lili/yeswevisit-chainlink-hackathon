## deploying the Game
FIRST:  clone the repo: https://github.com/layla-lili/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project.git
SECOND: cd blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
THIRD:  open project vscode or any IDE
FORTH:  yarn install or npm install
FIFTH:  if deploy locally make sure you have ganache-cli and truffle should be  installed globally
        if deploy on textnet (rinkeby) create ".env" file and place your memonic as
        REACT_APP_MNEMONIC = ... and your RPC_url as REACT_APP_RPC_URL = ... (infura or any other provider)
         and without comma (;) at the end and without qoutes.
SIXTH: run "truffle develop" | for windows users you may face some error so better use wsl2-ubuntu 20.4 terminal
SEVENTH: run "truffle test "
EAGHTH: IF TEST PASSES RUN  run  "truffle console --network development" to interact with contract locally   "truffle migrate --reset --compile-all" .
(for testnet make sure to get test eth from avaiable rinkeby faucet https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
or any future trusted faucet.
and "run truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby" for testnet

### React Frontend
FINALLY: if the all contract compiled and/or deployed run "yarn start" or "npm start"
the dapp will open at http://localhost:3000/  if port 3000 is avaible connect throght metmask and enjoy! ~(^w^)~
